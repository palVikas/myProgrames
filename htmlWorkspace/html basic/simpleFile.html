Held just twice, the 1999 championship was contested by India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[89] The first Test match between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens was previously scheduled as the third Test match of the tournament but later on was shifted to the first match. In the first match, Tendulkar was run out for nine after nd Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[92] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.</div></br></div>
